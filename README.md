How Synchronization works under the hood?
 Lock object with key(Key is also called monitor)
 
 When the Thread accesses the Synch method. The thread A request for the lock object, if the lock object has the key then it is handed over to the thread. 
 
 If Thread B tries to access the same synch method. The Thread B will request for the lock object, this time the lock object doesn't have the key as it was already handed over to Thread A. So Thread B has to wait.
 
 Once Thread A finished running the synch method it hands over the key to lock Object. So that it can be allocated to Thread B.
 
 
 # Concurrency - Executor Pattern
 
 Pool of thread is an - Executor interface.(Several Implementation available in JDK)
 
 public interface Executor{
 
  void execute(Runnable task);
  
 }
 
 ExecutorService is an extension of Executor
 
  public interface ExecutorService{
  
  //11 more methods
  
 }
 
 To Create an instance of Executor we have *factory class Executors* - provieds 20 methods
 
 Lets create a Thread pool with only one thread
 
 Exampel 1:
 
 ExecutorService singleThreadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); // Thread in this pool will be available as long as this pool is available.
 
 Exampel 2:
 
 ExecutorService multipleThreadExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPoolExecutor(8);
 
 # Waiting Queue Of ExecutorService
 
 ExecutorService singleThreadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
 
 Runnable task1  = () - > {System.out.println("Thread A")};
 
 Runnable task2  = () - > {System.out.println("Thread B")};
 
 multipleThreadExecutor.execute(task1);
 
 multipleThreadExecutor.execute(task2);
 
 When we run the above code. Task2 has to wait for Task1 to complete. The single thread executor has a waiting queue to handle that.
 
 
 This waiting queue is specified:
 
-A task is added to the waiting queue when no thread is available

-The tasks are executed in the order of their submission.

More questions:

Can we know if a task is done or not? - Noâ€¦

Can we cancel the execution of a task? - Yes, if the task has not started yet
